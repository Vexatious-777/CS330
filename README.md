Computer Graphics (OpenGL)
I approach designing software by quickly learning new material to work on software, when I lack the required knowledge and skills.
The skills and knowledge I learned within this course taught me how to use openGL to create believable 3D environments from a collection of
3D shapes and applying the correct textures and shaders to do so.
The design process I followed for my project work was to begin by working with a new skill
or piece of knowledge as I picked it up on a simpler version of it before scaling it up and using it in its entirety.
These tactics could be used in future work to properly scale up work on future software designs by meticulously building upon previous pieces into a more
realized final build can be brought to bear.
